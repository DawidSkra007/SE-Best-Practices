# SE-Best-Practices
This repository contains practical modules completed during a college semester, focusing on various best practices in software engineering. Each module covers essential concepts and techniques that contribute to building robust, maintainable, and scalable software solutions.

# Modules

#### Unit Testing ####
Description: This module emphasizes the importance of writing unit tests to ensure the correctness of individual units (functions, methods, classes) in the codebase. It covers popular testing frameworks and provides hands-on exercises for writing effective test cases.

#### Demeter's Principle ####
Description: This module introduces Demeter's Principle, also known as the Law of Demeter. It explains how to write code that follows the principle of least knowledge, reducing coupling and improving the maintainability of the code.

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) ####
Description: The ISP module delves into the Interface Segregation Principle, a key principle in object-oriented design. It demonstrates how to create cohesive and specific interfaces, avoiding unnecessary dependencies.

#### Open-Closed Principle (OCP) ####
Description: The OCP module explores the Open-Closed Principle, another vital concept in object-oriented design. It teaches how to design software modules that are open for extension but closed for modification, promoting software extensibility.

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) ####
Description: This module focuses on the Single Responsibility Principle, which advocates that a class should have only one reason to change. It guides participants in designing classes that are clear, focused, and easy to maintain.

#### Refactoring ####
Description: The Refactoring module covers various refactoring techniques that help improve the design and maintainability of existing code. Participants learn how to identify code smells and apply appropriate refactoring patterns.
